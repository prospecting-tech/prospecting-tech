        <p>How do some people on LinkedIn get hundreds and even thousands of likes and comments on their content, while others are lucky to get a handful of likes and perhaps a comment or two?</p>

        <p>The best way to go viral is to consistently create incredible content that attracts a large, loyal, relevant, and engaged audience who will comment on your posts.</p>

        <p>But what if you’ve got great content, but you’re still working on building that LinkedIn audience, and your posts just don’t seem to get traction?</p>

        <p>One tactic that can give your posts a little boost is to use LinkedIn engagement groups.</p>

        <p>The concept is simple: Gather a group of people who will like and comment on each others’ LinkedIn posts. This triggers the LinkedIn algorithm which thinks “Hey, this content is hot stuff, since so many people seem to be interested in it,”
          and then promotes that content in the LinkedIn feed to others who may be interested in it.</p>

        <p><strong>Engagement groups can help good content perform better, but they don’t make bad content popular.</strong></p>

        <p>One more side benefit of joining an engagement group–even ignoring the promotion aspect, it can be a great way to give you the motivation and accountability to create content regularly, and an audience who will provide you with helpful
          feedback.</p>

        <p>But there are also things that don’t go as planned. The most common reason a LinkedIn engagement group will lose steam and die is because everyone gets busy and can’t keep up. This may happen even in groups where the members are top-notch
          and so is the content, so don’t feel bad if you struggle managing a group and wonder why it’s not working out like you know it could.</p>

        <p>Another reason for the groups’ death is the lack of management. Some group members are very active, while others only get the benefits by requesting engagement, without putting any effort of engaging themselves.</p>

        <p><strong>This is why we created LeadsPod. Our job is to maintain the health of the groups and ensure a high quality standard.</strong></p>
